                            In this project, I developed a model to predict hourly energy consumption for the PJME interconnection using a time series dataset. The process involved data preprocessing, feature engineering, and visualization. I used the XGBoost algorithm to train the model, which was evaluated using Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) with a score of 3715.93 on the test set. The model's performance was visualized by comparing actual energy usage to predicted values, and feature importance was analyzed to understand the factors influencing energy demand. The project also included an error analysis to identify the most and least accurate predictions.</p>

                            This project involves training and testing a Radial Basis Function (RBF) neural network using mock production data from TRAIN10X.txt and TEST10X.txt. The network is trained over 10 iterations, where the weights are adjusted based on the difference between predicted and actual outputs. After training, the model is tested on unseen data, and its performance is analyzed by comparing outputs and tracking errors. Plots of the learning process, training/testing errors, and average errors reveal the network's ability to fit the data and generalize to new inputs, with weight adjustments improving accuracy over time.</p>

In the machine learning section, various techniques such as linear discriminant analysis (LDA), decision trees, and principal component analysis (PCA) are applied to classify species based on their physical features. The effectiveness of these methods is evaluated using confusion matrices, error rates, and visualizations. The Bayesian statistics task involves building and evaluating regression models, both full and reduced, using the BUGS language to estimate parameters and make predictions. The report concludes with an analysis of the results, including credible intervals and model comparisons based on the Deviance Information Criterion (DIC).</p>

The project involved collecting and filtering tweets, performing sentiment analysis to gauge public perceptions, and identifying key influencers in the conversation. Additionally, topic modeling was used to uncover primary themes related to environmental values in Europe. The insights gained from this analysis provided a clear understanding of public sentiment and the key topics driving discussions on EU environmental policies, offering valuable information for policy-making and public communication strategies.</p>

After comparing these approaches, I concluded that combining influence scoring with content-based filtering provides the most accurate recommendations by considering both user preferences and the strength of connections.</p>

                        <p class="card-text">The project involved analyzing survey data from 630 data professionals to gain insights into their demographics, job roles, favorite programming languages, and job satisfaction levels. The analysis included calculating the average age of participants and visualizing key metrics such as average salary by job title, programming language preferences, and the difficulty of breaking into the data field. The findings revealed that Python is the most popular programming language, participants primarily hail from the United States and India, and many find it challenging to enter the data profession. The project provided a comprehensive overview of the current landscape for data professionals, offering valuable insights into their experiences and preferences.</p>

                            I analyzed Airbnb listings to uncover pricing and demand patterns, focusing on factors like bedroom count, zip code, and seasonality. The analysis revealed that prices increase with more bedrooms, vary by location, and peak during summer and holidays. I recommended dynamic pricing, targeted marketing based on zip codes, and continuous data monitoring to optimize revenue and occupancy. These insights help Airbnb hosts make data-driven decisions to enhance their business performance.</p>
